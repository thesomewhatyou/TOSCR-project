# TOSCR-project - The Old School Computer Revival Project
## Optimize Minecraft performance, especially on older Intel iMacs!

## Introduction
TOSCR-project is a Minecraft modpack primarily aimed at optimizing Minecraft performance, reducing lag, and minimizing stutter. It's designed especially for iMacs with Intel chipsets and Intel Integrated Graphics, but it can generally work on virtually any computer.

## ⚠️ Important Warnings & Disclaimers
*   This is a highly experimental modpack. FYI, I am **NOT** a professional.
*   Issues can be reported on GitHub/Discord. You can also tag our (X)[https://x.com/TOSCR_project] bot and it'll automatically create an issue with your bodied text.
*   TOSCR-project is a very iffy modpack, as monthly updates maybe will be provided, but they may not be optimal.
*   EOL (End Of Life) status is unpredictable: EOL will be announced once things change, as it is now very predictable whether or not this modpack will be discontinued.
*   **Guarantees:**
    *   No bugs that affect gameplay
    *   A slow, yet steady release
    *   Around 100+ FPS for iMacs using this (Tested on a 2017 iMac. Not tested on any other machine.)
    *   Working on modern machines like the Bee-Link SER8 can give performance boosts of up to 300+ FPS with infinite FPS and VSync off.
*   **Note on M1-4 chips:** For safety purposes I'm going to say the M1-4 line of chips *probably* don't work with this.

## Why TOSCR-project?
I used a crusty old iMac. I know some people that still use it to this day. _(cough Christopher cough)_ Minecraft runs horribly on these kinda iMacs, with major stuttering and a deadly amount of lag (a lot worse than this modpack could be). That's why I made TOSCR-project. It can solve some lag and almost eliminate stutter. Testing, however, has come to a halt, as I no longer have an unfunctioning machine to work on.

## Minecraft Modpack Details

*   Just plop the file in MultiMC (or a fork of it!) and an instance will be instantly made.
