# TOSCR-project - thesomewhatyou's Old School Computer Revival Project
## Optimize Minecraft performance, even on your old PC!

## Introduction
TOSCR-project is a Minecraft modpack primarily aimed at optimizing Minecraft performance, reducing lag, and minimizing stutter. It's designed especially older PCs, but if you want to crank it up a notch, use it however you like.

## ⚠️ Important Warnings & Disclaimers
*   This is a highly experimental modpack. FYI, I am **NOT** a professional.
*   Issues can be reported on GitHub/Discord. You can also tag our (X)[https://x.com/TOSCR_project] bot and it'll automatically create an issue with your bodied text. It'll try probably.
*   TOSCR-project is a very iffy modpack, as monthly updates maybe will be provided, but they may not be optimal.
*   EOL (End Of Life) status is unpredictable: EOL will be announced once things change, as it is now very predictable whether or not this modpack will be discontinued.
*   **Guarantees:**
    *   No bugs that affect gameplay
    *   A slow, yet steady release
    *   Around 100+ FPS for PCs using this (Tested on a 2017 iMac. Not tested on any other machine. Not gonna bother doing it anyway.)
*   **Note on More Advanced Chipsets:** lmao you don't need this go away unless you want 1000+ FPS.

## Why make TOSCR-project?
I used a crusty old iMac. I know some people that still use it to this day. _(cough Christopher cough)_ Minecraft runs horribly on these kinda iMacs, with major stuttering and a deadly amount of lag (a lot worse than this modpack could be). That's why I made TOSCR-project. It can solve some lag and almost eliminate stutter. Testing, however, has come to a halt, as I no longer have an unfunctioning machine to work on.

## Minecraft Modpack Details

### Installation
*   Just plop the file in MultiMC (or a fork of it!) and an instance will be instantly made.
*   Using Modrinth? Just look up the modpack itself on Modrinth, as the modpack has been approved on the platform. Or CurseForge. 

### Mod List
*   The mod list is very complicated. If you are using either launcher, you can easily view the mods and disable them at will!
*   Looking on Modrinth, you can see it directly from the downloads page.
*   Forget about libraries. Literally so much. You don't need to know.

### Configuration
*   Configuring is super easy! Mod List is included with the modpack, allowing for easy customization, and not having to modify .jsons like a person who says btw i use arch on a daily basis.

### Compatibility
*   Some basic mods might not work with this modpack. Before using this, make sure that the mods you can add are ready-to-use with this modpack.
*   There are no known issues yet. Y E T.

## Reporting Issues

## A Final Word
